Once upon a time in the Singing Forest, lived Melody the Nightingale, Harmony the Bluebird, Rhythm the Robin, Trill the Canary, and Chord the Cardinal. Every morning, they gathered at the Singing Tree to greet the new day with their beautiful voices. The forest animals would wake to the sweet melodies, and even the flowers seemed to bloom brighter in response to the lovely tunes.

One morning, as the sun began to rise, a strange silence fell over the forest. The birds, concerned, quickly gathered at the Singing Tree. Melody asked, "Why has everything gone quiet?" Harmony fluttered her wings nervously, "I don't know, but it feels...empty."
