Bella loved their games. She would hop and flutter, always keeping just out of reach, until she decided to swoop down and perch on their heads and shoulders. The little ones would burst into laughter, trying to touch her soft feathers without startling her.

The park was filled with the fragrance of blooming flowers. Bright tulips and daisies swayed gently in the breeze. The small pond nearby glistened under the sun’s rays, with ducks swimming lazily. Bella’s favorite game was “Follow the Leader.” She would fly around the park in playful loops, with the children trailing behind, mimicking her every move. They would all collapse in a heap of giggles at the end, Bella chirping happily from her place on a child’s shoulder.

As evening approached, the sky was painted with hues of pink and orange. Bella led the kids back to the oak tree, where they sang one last song. The children waved her goodbye, knowing they would see her again the next day. Bella chirped in reply, fluttering back to her branch, her heart filled with joy.
