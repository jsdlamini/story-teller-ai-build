After a fun-filled afternoon, Bella decided to guide the children to a mystical meadow just beyond the park. The meadow was a sea of vibrant flowers with a small sparkling stream running through it. Bella led the little ones to the most beautiful, hidden spots. Together, they picked wildflowers and played hide-and-seek. Every now and then, Bella would find a shady spot under an ancient willow tree where the children could rest and listen to her charming songs.

As the sun began to set, Bella accompanied the kids back to the park, ensuring everyone got home safely. Each child waved goodbye, thankful for another magical day with their feathered friend. Bella soared back to her oak tree, satisfied and excited for the next adventure.
